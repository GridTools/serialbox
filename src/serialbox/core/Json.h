/// However the ADL-enablers (to_json, from_json) are not included in the types declaration header
/// to not pollute the public interface with the json library. Therefore we need to include the
/// <MyType>Serializer.hpp in files where we want to do <MyType> <-> json conversions. Do this only
/// in cpp-files or private headers.
