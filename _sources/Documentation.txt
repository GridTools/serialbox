Building Documentation
**********************

This section is concerned with building and deploying the Documentation you are currently reading.
   
.. _Prerequisite:

Prerequisite
============

Serialbox requires `doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_ and `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.4.8/>`_. As sphinx imports the Python module of Serialbox to obtain the doc-strings, we require the Python3 version of sphinx. In Ubuntu (16.04), the following install the necessary packages:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo apt-get install doxygen python3-sphinx

To enable the documentation, configure the project with the CMake variable ``SERIALBOX_DOCUMENTATION`` set to ON:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cmake -DSERIALBOX_DOCUMENTATION=ON ../

As mentioned, sphinx imports the Python module and thus Serialbox should be built with ``SERIALBOX_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON`` (which is default). 

.. _Building:

Building
========

If CMake was able to pick up doxygen and sphinx, it will provide a ``docs`` target:

.. code-block:: console

  $ make docs

This will install the documentation into ``docs/sphinx/_build/html`` and you can immedialtly view it by opening ``docs/sphinx/_build/html/index.html`` in your favorite browser.

Deploying
=========

GitHub provides the ability to upload your website to `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_. To to this, we need to push the website to the ``gh-pages`` branch. The script ``tools/deploy-docs.sh`` does exactly this, meaning: Cloning the branch ``gh-pages``, copying the website from ``docs/sphinx/_build/html/`` and commiting and pushing the changes to your remote. To ease the burden, CMake was configured to provide a target to invoke the script:

.. code-block:: console

  $ make deploy-docs
  
To view your website, head to http://username.github.io/serialbox2 .
